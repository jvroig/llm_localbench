I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.
