Example #1:
Product Name: Provence French Country-style Wardrobe
Review text: 
```
I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par.

Product Name: Vintage Elegance Vanity
Review text: 
```
I am extremely disappointed with it. The quality of the product is very poor and does not meet my expectations at all. The materials used feel cheap and the vanity arrived with several scratches and dents. The assembly instructions were also confusing and the whole process took much longer than anticipated. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
